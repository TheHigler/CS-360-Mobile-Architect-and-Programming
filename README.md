Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

I developed a weight tracking application. The goal of the application is to allow users to track their weight loss, gain, or maintenance journey. This will help users stay commited to their journey by seeing their progress. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I needed a log-in screen, a weight logging screen, and a screen that displayed the users logged weigh-ins. The goal was to keep the application simple to allow for a wider user base. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the application one screen at a time. Being able to maintain my focus on creating and completing one screen successfully showed me how I can implement similar things throughout the other screens in my application. Using this mentality in the future I feel will help me stay focused and not feel so overwhelmed with the overall project. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested the application through the emulator to ensure each aspect of my application worked as intended.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I don't feel I had to be innovative within the application development process. If anything, I was hindered by learning some aspects I would have liked to add such as a line graph. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I feel my log-in screen was the best implementation as I was able to work and refine it as the weeks went on.
